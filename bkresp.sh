# This script will create a backup file of a postgres database and compress it.  It is capable of access a local or remote server to pull the backup.  After creating a new backup, it will delete backups that are older than 15 days, with the exception of backups created the first of every month.  It is recommended to create a seperate database user specifically for backup purposes, and to set the permissions of this script to prevent access to the login details.  Backup scripts
